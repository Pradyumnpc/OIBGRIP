            <b>Shane Keith Warne (13 September 1969 – 4 March 2022) was an Australian cricketer. He captained the Australian national team in One Day Internationals (ODI). He is often called the greatest bowlers in the history of the sport. He took 708 wickets from 40,704 balls bowled during his Test career. He has the second most wickets in Test history and most of any leg spin bowler. He retired from international cricket in January 2007, at the end of Australia's 5–0 Ashes series whitewash victory over England. After retirement from playing, he was a cricket commentator.

                Warne was born in Upper Ferntree Gully, an outer suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. He had three children with his ex-wife Simone Callahan. He had complete heterochromia, from which one of his eyes is blue, and the other green.[1]
                
                Warne died from a possible heart attack on 4 March 2022 at his villa on the island of Ko Samui in Thailand. He was 52.
